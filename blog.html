<h2>Scripture Paraphrase</h2>
<section class="blog_content">
    <div class="blog_entry" id="hebrews1:1-4">
        <h3>HEBREWS 1:1-4</h3>
<p>
No more passing notes.<br>
No more “Thus saith the Lord,”
</p>
<p>
Now is the time to learn the timbre of the Voice,<br>
The Voice that sent the sun to do its shining,<br>
Set the earth to do her turning,<br>
Kindled man to do his breathing.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now comes the straight shot<br>
From Maker’s Lips to our humble hearts.
</p>
<p>
We have never had this clear of a signal,<br>
This brilliant of a view,<br>
This close of a seat to the Majesty fireworks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yet here we are, peasants invited to the Grand Festival.
</p>
<p>
A personal invitation from the lips of the Promised One.
</p>
<p>
He has the authority to do all the inviting he wants,<br>
After all, He is the Host.<br>
The Coordinator, Designer, Architect….<br>
The Guest of Honor, the Head of the Table, the Great Artist<br>
</p>
<p>
The One to inherit all there is.<br>
The One who started it all.
</p>
<p>
There before Beginning.<br>
There to cause Beginning.<br>
There at End.<br>
There to carry us past End.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
    Because of Him,
</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;">
        All is.<br>
        All is His.
    </p>

<p>
What kind of Being could have designed all Beauty?<br>
</p>
<p>
What goes on in that Imagination?<br>
How is that Skill cultivated?<br>
Who measures that Power?<br>
</p>
Surely He is Source.


<p>
Source of every light beam,<br>
Source of every inspiration,<br>
Source of every heartbeat,<br>
Source of every love story.<br>
</p>
<p>
Surely no good thing can be traced to another beginning but the light of this Lovely
Face.
</p>
<p>
Surely nothing has been found beautiful that was not first touched by Him.
</p>
<p>
True from the inside out,<br>
He is exactly Who He Is.
</p>
<p>
No inconsistencies in His behavior,<br>
No evil secrets from His past,
</p>
<p>
Never wishy-washy<br>
Never learning<br>
Never fading<br>
Never decaying<br>
Never waking up feeling differently<br>
</p>
<p>
Oh Divine Glory that will not dull,<br>
For truly it cannot dull.
</p>
<p>
For to grow dim would be to change<br>
And to change would be to shift from Who You Are,<br>
And to shift from Who You Are would be to fail,<br>
And to fail would be more than impossible for the Great I AM,
</p>
<p>
And You Are the Great I AM,<br>
I AM is Who You Are
</p>
<p>
And all that is began in I AM.
</p>
<p>
Take away I AM,<br>
All would be less than nothing.
</p>
<p>
Nothing ever happened,<br>
Nothing was ever thought,<br>
Nothing was ever made.<br>
</p>
<p>
No light ever shone,<br>
No word ever spoken.
</p>
<p>
No Word- no universe.
</p>

<p>
Even now, if the Word stops speaking- no universe.
</p>
<p>
There must be Power in the Word upon which a universe depends<br>
A Powerful Word to generate a universe on which a great many zillion times zillion
words are spoken in its lifetime.
</p><br>

<p>
Yes, take away Word and There Is Not.
</p>
<p>
But, Hallelujah, the Word Is,
</p>
<p>
And thus there is laughter. There is Christmas. There is ocean. There is Mother and
Father. There is laughter. There is sleep. There is adventure. There is friendship.
There is freedom.
</p>
<p>
Ah, but with freedom came choice, with choice came wrong choice, very, very wrong
choice, with very, very wrong choice came death.
</p>
<p>
Word has spoken,<br>
Word has made,<br>
Word has watched what was made drift away.
</p>
<p>
Yet He has gone after.<br>
He has journeyed.
</p>
<p>
Oh He has journeyed!<br>
Starting point: Heaven<br>
Destination: Earth.
</p>
<p>
Packing nothing but Himself,<br>
Trading Throne of Unfiltered Joy, Things Functioning As They Are Intended, God
Worshipped as Only Makes Sense,
</p>
<p>
for Earth,<br>
compressed into humanness<br>
(how suffocating for Supreme Being)<br>
inside a womb<br>
to open his eyes to the Land Where Things Don’t Function,<br>
the world whose top played song is God Is Not Welcome Here.
</p>
<p>
But He ventures beyond this change of address,
</p>
<p>
He exposes Himself to all shades of the human grind, the tragic and even the
unpleasant,<br>
The headaches, tired eyes, hiccups, blisters, friends bailing on you, stomach
growling, plants withering, anxiety of dying, Satan’s clinginess, judgment from
church people, pressure from family’s expectations, feeling misunderstood, close
friends dying, acute betrayal, suffering and shame.
</p><br>

<p>
God Himself creates Beautiful World,<br>
Free of all these vexations.
</p>
<p>
He deserves kisses and eternal thanks.
</p>
<p>
World says, “No, you can’t be trusted.<br>
You’re not as pretty as the stuff you make.<br>
Don’t bother us, let us be us the way we want.”
</p>
<p>
God bails not.<br>
God destroys-Earth not.<br>
God punches-us-directly-in-the-face not.
</p>
<p>
Rather…
</p>
<p>
God, Author of all Story,<br>
Writes Himself in the Story.
</p>
<p>
God writes,
</p>
<p>
“God dies.”
</p>
<p>
God, Life and Life Giver dies.
</p>
<p>
God, who does no wrong, not even thinks wrong, dies.
</p>
<p>
God, Love and Love Giver and Love Giver Still, dies.
</p>
<p>
God, NOT MAN- WHO HAS PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE A LIAR, A THIEF, A MURDERER,
A WHORE, A PSYCHOPATH, AN ADDICT, A WRETCHED HELPLESS SELFISH
UNGRATEFUL WORM,
</p>
<p>
But God, who has proven Himself to be Creator, Promise Maker, Promise Keeper,
Refuge, Deliverer, Warrior, King, Giver, Provider, Shepherd, Healer, Master, Father
</p>
<p>
Voluntarily dies.
</p>
<p>
Not passes-peacefully-in-His-sleep
</p>
<p>
No, dies the death of a man condemned<br>
Though innocent, no: though Innocence,<br>
dies the necessary death of the very guilty.
</p>

<p>
Those Hands and Arms that held the deaf man’s face as He gave him his hearing,
held the dead little girl’s hand as he woke her up, drew the line in the sand before
the adulterous woman, that washed His friends’ dirty feet:<br>
Outstretched on a cross with nails plunged through them.
</p>
<p>
Those Feet, calloused from walking from town to town to heal the sick, walked on
water, walked into homes of the broken outcasts, going after His friends:
They too receive nails.
</p>
<p>
Those Lips, announcing peace, inviting us to the Grand Wedding Feast, telling us
Secrets of Heaven, calling dead men out of their tombs, calming storms:
Cracked with dehydration, receiving sour wine as His drink.
</p>

<p>
Yet however great the agony of nails hammered through flesh and blood,
However bruising the shame of public beatings and wrongful execution
In the presence of your mother and brothers….
</p>
<p>
Human minds cannot suffer through the concept of all He endured.
</p>
<p>
Divinity meets flesh is wild enough.<br>
But sin hitting Jesus…
</p>
<p>
Landing on the Shoulders,<br>
Oh, the Shoulders that have and will have balanced Eden, Jericho, Babylon, Rome,
Constantinople, Beijing, London, New York, and Texas,
</p>
<p>
Will absorb the weight of every sin,<br>
Of every intention of every thought of every heart of every man<br>
Of every tribe of every generation ever made<br>
each sin being an added weight, a further degree of separation from God: LIFE
</p>
<p>
This is no death.
</p>
<p>
This is DEATH x DEATH x DEATH x DEATH all the way back to the fruit,<br>
The fruit we just had to have because He said we couldn’t have it.
</p>
<p>
This is sin in full maturity, bloodthirsty and ready to attack<br>
with all its torture shot directly to the core of the Perfect Soul,<br>
Hitting the only One that did nothing to deserve it.
</p>
<p>
God does-what-is-fair not.<br>
God does-what-makes-sense not.
</p>

<p>
God does-things-halfway not.<br>
God stops-there-not.
</p>
<p>
God proves stronger than the force of the Great Rebellion<br>
Life proves more relentless than ever-gnawing-and-robbing Death<br>
Love, poured out as the blood of God on the ones He loves, proves a more potent<br>
Medicine than the rejection poured out by every human on this God.
</p>
<p>
As members of the truly guilty Rebellion lean in to hammer the nails,
they hear Him whisper-plead their forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Grave could not hold down the Lover who aches to see His Bride.<br>
He dies.<br>
He gets up.<br>
He dies never again.
</p>
<p>
Majesty proven.<br>
Majesty always His,<br>
Now seen like never before.
</p>
<p>
God relents not.<br>
I understand not.<br>
I will find-another-I–love-more not.

        <h3>Luke 1:26-37</h3>
        <p>
            You will call him Jesus. 
        </p><br>

<p>
He will be something Brand New. 
</p>

<p>
He is the Beloved Darling of the Good Father. 
</p><br>


<p>
Good Father is going to use Him to answer all the promises He has made.
</p><br>



<p>
The Spirit of the Artist will dance over you,<br>
He will breathe His music on you,<br>
And this will spark the Light within you. <br>
</p>

<p>
You will play host to this Light for 9 months,<br>
And then He will enter the world’s stage.
</p>

<p>
So different than us and exactly like us.
</p>

<p>
He’ll inhale oxygen<br>
Walk on two legs<br>
He’ll be bruisable and ticklish <br>
Susceptible to disease and pain <br>
He’ll feel shame, <br>
Get nervous
</p>


<p>
He’ll take on this stuff,<br>
This human stuff
</p>

<p>
Heaven dwellers don’t get nervous
Their bodies don’t get sore
</p><br>


<p>
But the God-man will let Himself feel this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
Because the Great Wall is coming down
</p>

<p>
The dividing wall.<br>
God and all His Glory on one side<br>
Us and all our stuff on the other.
</p>

<p>
And who are we without our God? 
</p><br>


<p>
We drew this line with the juice of the fruit<br>
And said, “Don’t cross; there must be boundaries.<br>
Don’t tell us what to do, we need boundaries,<br>
We need our space!”
</p>

<p>
On that boundary line we have stacked bricks:<br>
One brick for each decision to rebel<br>
One brick for each pang of shame<br>
One brick for each doubt that the Good Heart is good.
</p><br>



<p>
God is stirring up the Scandal.<br>
He is crossing that boundary. 
</p>

<p>
Not even our shame can stack too high for Him to cross.<br>
It’s just a matter of if He wants to see us after all this<br>
If He wants to get tangled up in all our stuff. 
</p><br>


<p>
Here is the Opening Round of the Extravagant Rescue.
</p>

<p>
And He starts with a Kiss.<br>
He crosses the boundary,<br>
Coming with His Kiss.
</p>

<p>
He’s kissing you first, Sweet Mary! 
</p>

<p>
Every mother gives birth and holds her tiny gift in her arms,<br>
But you will be the first to hold Earth’s Gift.
</p>

<p>
Man’s Relief<br>
Heaven’s Fugitive
</p>

<p>
He has crossed the Boundary! 
</p>

<p>
And you will call him Jesus: 
</p>

<p>
This name…
</p>

<p>
That you whisper over your drowsy babe as he drifts off<br>
That you share with your friends as they fawn over the new family member,<br>
That you shout as you summon him for supper<br>
Yes, you’ll give him a name<br>
Like you would give a name to any other child,<br>
So people know how to address him<br>
To distinguish him from the other children.
</p>

<p>
But this is no ordinary child. 
</p>

<p>
You will give Him a Name
</p>

<p>
That people will whisper in wonder as they first hear the Too Good to Be True<br>
That generations will sing, shout in Victory<br>
That wakes up the dead<br>
That unlocks chains<br>
That opens blind eyes<br>
That turns funerals into celebrations<br>
That drenches troubled souls in Relief<br>
That returns Joy to the weary world<br>
That leads refugees into a Brand New World
</p><br>


<p>
That calls us to Safe Home
</p><br><br>



<p>
For He will draw a map back Home with His own Blood<br>
And every mouth will swear allegiance <br>
To this Name. 
</p><br>


<p>
Jesus:<br>
Jesus the Life that makes a Way<br>
For the lovers of Life that have dreaded death since they knew what it was<br>
because it would take them away from this LIFE, this wonderful, wonderful LIFE that we don’t want to leave,<br>
Oh, Jesus will whisper “Sweet baby, Life has not even begun!”
</p>

<p>
He will restore Reality,<br>
Get rid of the boring humanity-without-God stuff<br>
He will bring us our God back. <br>
He will kiss us back to God. 
</p>

<p>
Receive this Kiss, sweet girl.
</p> 

<p>
To the eyes around you, the headline will be<br>
“Virgin gives birth???”
</p>

<p>
That’s secondary.<br>
It’s a simple Breath.
</p> 

<p>
In//out//done.
</p>

<p>
God puts Life wherever he wants.
</p>

<p>
How else would all of This have started? 
</p>

<p>
No, the mouth-open-fall-to-your-knees-face-to-the-ground//can’t believe this!!!! Miracle is that
</p>

<p>
He is coming.
</p> 

<p>
Too Beautiful to look at<br>
So He’ll dress Himself up in skin and whiskers<br>
Lest our eyes burn when He looks at us
</p><br>


<p>
Love will show up for us.
</p>

<p>
Because Love is interested in us.
</p> 

<p>
Faithful past logic.
</p> 

<p>
Willing, no Determined to get His Heart broken
</p> 

<p>
For us,
</p>

<p>
For He is in Love With Us….Immanuel: God [Love} With Us.
</p>

<p>
Seems impossible.
</p>

<p>
But NOTHING WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD.

        <h3>Isaiah 9:1-7</h3>
<p>
There we stood,<br>
Shoulder-deep in trouble<br>
Wading in sorrows,<br>
Drowning in doom.
</p>

<p>
Cue your typical “but……” to change where this is headed.
</p>

<p>
You just love writing that,<br>
Looking on hopeless situations and turning them around.
</p><br>


<p>
You observe our misery and install a shift,
</p> 

<p>
You foreshadow our new condition:
</p><br>


<p>
Then this, the best one to ever be pronounced
</p><br>


<p>
<em>“But there will be no gloom.”</em>
</p>

<p>
No gloom:<br>
We don’t even know “no gloom.”<br>
Not even what it looks like.
</p>  

<p>
For this world is our only environment.
</p>

<p>
How can we even hope for something we know nothing about?
</p>

<p>
“No gloom” requires The One and Only to come show His Face.
</p>

<p>
So that’s exactly what you’ve done.
</p> 

<p>
Shadows vanish as the Sunrise enters the scene.
</p><br><br>



<p>
Hear the Great Consolation, weary ones! <br>
Feel the Great Pleasure, those who are dead inside! 
</p>

<p>
The True Gift comes bearing gifts!<br>
He has brought us Himself. 
</p>

<p>
He is ours for the taking. 
</p><br>


<p>
We were trapped in the incessant winter, <br>
But You will warm us up with your Presence
</p>

<p>
We were lonely and starving and doomed,
</p>

<p>
But now we feast.<br>
Now we dance. 
</p><br>


<p>
For we are relieved! 
</p>

<p>
Our tyrant slave driver, single-minded and shooting to kill,<br>
Has lost custody of us, his orphan slaves. 
</p>

<p>
We were trapped in his death-smoked chains
</p> 

<p>
But the curse has been lifted.
</p>

<p>
And not only that…for the demise of one evil ruler would only be a temporary fix. <br>
We would merely be orphans, vulnerable to the next malicious bully.<br>
No,
</p>

<p>
The curse has been reversed!
</p>

<p>
We have been signed over to the domain of a new King!
</p>

<p>
We have been given <b>to</b> our Deliverer.<br>
And as always, He goes another infinite degree further:<br>
Because we have also been <em><b>given</b> </em>our Deliverer. 
</p>

<p>
We borrow you not,<br>
We rent you not<br>
We earn you not
</p>

<p>
You are ours, our Gift to treasure,<br>
forever times infinity times beyond
</p>

<p>
The Good One has taken over,<br>
Has claimed the lost rebels as His own,
</p>

<p>
You have witnessed our every skinned knee, every bruise<br>
You have been awake every night we’ve been sick, <br>
No way could we recall every tear we have cried,<br>
But you can. <br>
You know the exact weight of our burden,<br>
And now You have rushed in to help.
</p>

<p>
You have charged toward us<br>
and lifted the weight off our shoulders,<br>
carrying it far, far away, impossible for us to reclaim,<br>
 on your own perfectly lovely Shoulders.
</p>

<p>
You have crushed it,<br>
Chunked it to the bottom of the sea.
</p> 

<p>
There you are:<br>
Lifting burdens <br>
Defending prisoners<br>
Dropping jaws<br>
Triggering devotion<br>
Outliving/outstanding/outdancing all else we ever knew
</p>

<p>
You bring the Permanent Celebration 
</p>

<p>
Returning every lost and jagged piece of our hearts:<br>
You send them pounding in chests.
</p>

<p>
You send babies leaping in wombs,<br>
For they know<br>
You are the Prince.
</p>

<p>
You are our Prince.<br>
Ordaining peace. 
</p>

<p>
My eyes will land on my Savior and my mouth will form the words:
</p><br>


<p>
<em>Wonderful:</em>  for what awakes deeper wonder than the God-man, divinity meets flesh and bone?
</p><br><br>



<p>
<em>Mighty:</em>  unfaltering certainty and control that cannot lose
</p><br>


<p>
<em>Everlasting:</em>  for you are I AM
</p>

<p>
You will earn the spoil of the Kingdom that Cannot Be Shaken,<br>
You’ll finance her jewels and treasure with your own blood.<br>
Your own body will be the foundation of the castle.
</p>


<p>
You stack peace on peace on peace on peace on peace. <br>
Kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss. <br>
For us<br>
Forever. 
</p>

<p>
Everything we could want in a King. <br>
Everything we could want in a Dad.<br>
Everything we could want to have and to hold. 
</p><br>


<p>
May we receive you, Royal Servant
</p>

<p>
Making enough space for your Majesty.
</p>

<p>
More splendor in the twinkle of your Eye than all of our earth-kings combined could hope to summon.
</p><br>


<p>
May we know that we can finally unclench our fists,<br>
 for our every battle has been fought on our behalf
</p>

<p>
May we throw our arms open ready to wrap them around You.
</p>

<p>
May we be ready.
</p>

<p>
Yes, we’re ready<br>
For this Most Wonderful Season with You.
</p><br><br>



<p>
All my love to the Holy Gumption of my Raving Husband.

Only He would have written this.

        <h3>John 1:1-18</h3>
        <p>
            First Forever<br>
Before the Start<br>
Already All He Is<br>
Complete. God. 
        </p>

<p>
Ready to cause to exist.
</p> 

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
All that exists:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
    Trace yourself back to this Being.<br>
    Look on to the Whom that brought you here<br>
    You and I,<br>
    He is our How<br>
    He is our Why
</p>

<p>
For He is First Life
Life itself
Purest Form
Life so strong that it gives off its own Light
</p>

<p>
Light never extinguished. 
</p>

<p>
As the world grew detached from this light, darkness invaded and has grown like cancer.
</p> 

<p>
But the Light showed up here<br>
To recover what has been lost in the darkness,<br>
To reclaim what has forgotten its true form.
</p>

<p>
This light is no imitation,<br>
No temporary snapshot,<br>
No weak flicker
</p>

<p>
<b>
    No, to tell the Full Story Himself<br>
    He had to share the Full Story, which <em>is</em> Himself
</b>
</p>

<p>
He moved in, but we were not ready<br>
We didn’t know what to do with Him <br>
And all of His Truth
</p>

<p>
For the Truth leaves no room for lies<br>
And we had grown addicted to our lies
</p>

<p>
But His One-and-Only-ness-<br>
Oh, it’s irresistible <br>
Once you start wanting Him, you can’t stop
</p>

<p>
Because there are no substitutes<br>
Nothing can pretend to be Him<br>
He will not be knocked off
</p>

<p>
Once you see him as is<br>
You want him always
</p>

<p>
And in wanting him<br>
You find Him<br>
And you find you, too!
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
Not the you that can’t get a grip,<br>
Not the you that’s desperate for attention<br>
That lies to receive approval<br>
Binges on cheap thrills and candies of this world to get hungry again in five minutes,<br>
Not the depressed, anxious, strung out, discouraged, angry, bitter, judgmental, resentful, fake, confused, lonely, lazy, wounded….
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
    Shadow of yourself
</p><br>


<p>
But your divinely crafted, lovingly-formed-and-shaped by-majestic-hands self
</p>

<p>
Your soul that has been relentlessly hunted,<br>
Your heart that has been ruthlessly obsessed over,<br>
Your future that has been planned and won
</p>

<p>
You find yourself as one who is nonsensically loved by the Divine Madman, <em>pazzo d'amore, ebro d'amore*</em> 
</p>

<p>
You find that you have been born,<br>
Not from a line of divorces, addiction, abuse, depression, cancer, cheating, bankruptcy, and brokenness
</p>

<p>
But from God, the Father of Lights
</p>

<p>
The One we couldn’t see <br>
Until Jesus Christ made himself to look like us
</p>

<p>
Who after spending nine months in a woman’s body,<br>
Came out with shoulders, elbows, knees,<br>
Blood and tissue,<br>
Muscles and organs
</p>

<p>
Who craved bread, grew sleepy after a long day,<br>
Sneezed and coughed<br>
Went to school<br>
Grew calloused hands as he worked in his trade<br>
Loved his brothers and took care of his mother<br>
Laughed until his sides ached<br>
Wept bitterly when his friend died<br>
Played jokes on his friends<br>
Looked Satan in the eyes in the desert of temptation<br>
Felt anxiety and anguish as he walked to his death
</p>

<p>
From cradle to grave endured the human experience,<br>
The joys and the woes, <br>
Lest we ever say “You don’t know us,<br>
You don’t know life, or what it’s been like.<br>
We can’t even see you, how can we follow you?” 
</p>

<p>
No, this Son of God, loved and beautiful beyond all words,<br>
Knowing we needed Him,<br>
Left His heaven address <br>
And was seen walking around this planet Earth<br>
<b>As if that is normal or possible</b>
</p>

<p>
People breezed right past him, not understanding <br>
That they just encountered All they could ever want<br>
That they just beheld with their own eyes
</p>

<p>
Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness and Self-control
</p>

<p>
From the core of his God-being<br>
To the split ends of his hair<br>
Everything of Him and in Him<br>
Is a Gift to mankind
</p>

<p>
A Gift that we would have never even known to ask for<br>
Had God Himself not planned this Love-Miracle all along<br>
Before we even got here and needed it
</p>

<p>
This Gift- in the weirdest, most glorious package:<br>
The Heart of God wrapped up in sun-kissed skin
</p>

<p>
Touching us/ breathing on us.
</p>

<p>
All this giving! When will it stop??<br>
Giving and then more Giving<br>
More than the world has ever known
</p>

<p>
God has always been giving, but we get distracted by the gift
</p>

<p>
We think that the gift is The Thing.
</p>

<p>
Well now, this Jesus- ----God Himself, the True Gift<br>
Gifts us Himself,
</p>

<p>
And the world has the chance to come alive at the knowledge of God through this introduction. 
</p>

<p>
God has kissed Earth through the body of Jesus, who says,<br> 
“Dear Earth, 
</p>

<p>
This is God, and this is how He feels about you. This is the way back to Him.” 
</p>

<p>
Let us kiss him back! 
</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Isaiah 40</h3>
        <p>
            Darling, settle down.<br>
    It’s ok. <br>
    Lay your head down and take a deep breath.
        </p>


<p>
    The last shot has been fired.<br>
    War is over.<br>
    I won for you.<br>
    I won you.
</p>

<p>
    You’re mine now<br>
    All mine<br>
    Mine to do whatever I want <br>
    And it is my dream <br>
    To take you back to the start<br>
    To show you what I always wanted for you.
</p><br>


<p>
    This will be brand new territory for you.<br>
    You’ve never lived in a world like this.<br>
    Exile has been your nationality. <br>
    Chains have been your uniform.<br>
    Prison bars your habitat.
</p>

<p>
    But now look out!
</p>

<p>
    Make way for the King riding in<br>
    To claim his prize!
</p>

<p>
    You may want to cover your eyes…<br>
    They may be blinded by the blazing light streaming from the smile on my face as I come to get you.
</p>

<p>
    You thought this place was your forever,<br>
    Yet, poof, it’s gone.<br>
    You thought these people were your forever,<br>
    And blink, they are gone.
</p>

<p>
    Tears? What, no!<br>
    Sing,<br>
    Laugh from your core,<br>
    Yell out like you never have before!
</p>

<p>
    Do not hold back, <br>
    This is everything.
</p>

<p>
    Save your voice no longer,
</p>

<p>
    This is what it was made for.
</p><br>


<p>
    Eyes on me,<br>
    See me? <br>
    Your love,<br>
    Your warrior
</p><br>


<p>
    I carry you close to my breast<br>
    So you can feel my very heartbeat,<br>
    So you can watch me rise to defend you.<br>
    Let me show off for you!
</p>

<p>
    Drown in the honor of being chased by a God
</p> 

<p>
    In whose hands the entire ocean rests.<br>
    Even the heavens fit in my palm.
</p><br>


<p>
    No one showed me the ropes of being God.
</p>

<p>
    Who tells me where to go<br>
    Or can fathom all that I can do?
</p><br>


<p>
    Who will ever wade deep in to the waters of my wonders?
</p>

<p>
    What imagination will venture into the untraversed lands of my mind?
</p>

<p>
    Build whatever you want<br>
    Sell all you have to buy the parts<br>
    And pour your entire being for all your days to create the life you want,
</p>

<p>
    But you’ll come up with nothing <br>
    Nothing with magnificence. 
</p>

<p>
    Not compared to mine.
</p> <br>


<p>
    If you seek to replicate me<br>
    Fall for someone else…<br>
    You’ve already missed it<br>
    Listen, look at me<br>
    Come back to the first thing.
</p>

<p>
    Before ever there was question, there was ANSWER.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
    I AM.
</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3em;">
        Who is the one who created you?
    </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
    I AM. 
</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3em;">
        Who is the one you truly desire?
    </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
    I AM.
</p> 
    <p style="margin-left: 3em;">
        Who is the one you were made for?
    </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
    I AM.
</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3em;">
        Who is the one to protect you?
    </p><br>


<p>
    Don’t mistake my patience for indifference.
</p>

<p>
    You have abused my kindness in your ignorance<br>
    Presuming that anger does not surge within my furious heart every single time you step out of our union.<br>
    Every time you pour your love on the lifeless
</p>

<p>
    Or 75-years-max before-they-go lifeless,
</p>

<p>
    I won’t have it,<br>
    Not for you.<br>
    I won’t have my beloved waste her love, her life’s blood on imitation love<br>
    That I can wipe out with a breath.
</p>

<p>
    Set me up against whatever you think you want right now
</p>

<p>
    ALL vs. nothing
</p><br>


<p>
    And the disparity is ghastly.
</p>

<p>
    We are not to be compared.
</p>

<p>
    Come awake from your drunken delusion.
</p>

<p>
    If not one single star has ever twinkled without my nod of approval,<br>
    Don’t lie to yourself by thinking it’s possible that I have missed even one act of this glory thievery,<br>
    Your drunk anti-worship, <br>
    Not one second of it has gone unseen…
</p>

<p>
    Without wounding me.
</p>

<p>
    I see every wound it brings to you too,<br>
    And you don’t even realize it most of the time.
</p><br>


<p>
    How much sense does it make to suggest I don’t care for you,
</p>

<p>
    When I AM still here with you?
</p>

<p>
    I don’t have to stay with you.
</p>

<p>
    You don’t have anything I need to survive.
</p>

<p>
    I’m here with you because I want to be,
</p>

<p>
    And I’m not going anywhere.
</p>

<p>
    Hear this as a drastically different promise than you are used to receiving:
</p>

<p>
    God promise >>>>>>>>>human
</p>  

<p>
    Does not equal
</p>

<p>
    Human promise>>>>>>>>>>>>> human
</p> 

<p>
    Humans live with zero control over anything except who they love. 
</p>

<p>
    So every human promise is always followed by a clause.
</p> 

<p>
    Even the noblest promise from the purest human love:
</p>

<p>
    I promise to love you….as long as we both shall live.
</p>

<p>
    Man finds woman he loves, chooses to live out his remaining days with her, committed to her, to love and to cherish her, in sickness and in health……….as long as we both shall live.
</p> 

<p>
    Yes, he will love you all his days, but those days will run out
</p>

<p>
    Humans die.
</p><br> 


<p>
    I AM does not die. 
</p>

<p>
    I AM with you always. 
</p>

<p>
    Always. Always. Always. Always. Forever amen. 
</p>

<p>
    I started all of this and will outlive it all,<br>
    And I will preserve the ones I rescue to outlive it with me.
</p> <br>


<p>
    You will never hear me say I’m too tired. <br>
    That I need space.<br>
    That I need alone time.
</p>

<p>
    You will never come to talk to me and find me distracted.
</p>

<p>
    I don’t need sick days. 
</p>

<p>
    I don’t get stressed or overwhelmed.
</p>

<p>
    No, <br>
    I AM.
</p> 

<p>
    Watch me and learn Me.
</p>

<p>
    Watch Me never lie to you<br>
    Never cheat on you<br>
    Never betray you <br>
    Never harm you
</p><br>


<p>
    Rise up to my level and see things from my view.
</p>

<p>
    It is magnificent to live as I live. 
</p>

<p>
    Soar on my wings, ride at my speed<br>
    On my dime and my strength<br>
    And experience the glory of being Mine. 
</p>
